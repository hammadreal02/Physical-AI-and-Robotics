    # The ROS2 and Gazebo Python tests require a fully configured ROS2/Gazebo environment.
    # Setting up such an environment in a standard GitHub Actions runner is complex.
    # These tests are commented out for now, and would typically be run in a specialized CI setup
    # (e.g., using a custom Docker image with ROS2/Gazebo pre-installed).
